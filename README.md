# Analyzing-Amazon-Reviews-with-NLP

This project uses Amazon reviews data to perform text analysis by:

1) Removing stop-words
2) Steming words using Porter 1979
3) Creating a frequency table for word stems in reviews
4) Measuring distance between reviews 
5) Comparing results with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Afterwords, we use logistic regression to predict ratings (5 levels) of a product and measure the out-of-sample accuracy.

Lastly, we compare products by aggregating reviews by product and comparing distances in products by text comparisons of those reviews, similar to the exercise above.
